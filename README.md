# ML Algorithm Coursework

## Introduction
  Coursework for ML Algorithm, including **K-Means and NearMiss based Prototype Selection for  Nearest Neighbor 
  Classifier** and **Coordinate Descent for Logistic Regression: Integrating A\* Search and Weighted Selection**.

## Our work
- We research on **K-Means and NearMiss based Prototype Selection for Nearest Neighbor Classifier**, refer to 
[Project report](./Prototype%20Selection%20for%201-NN%20Classifier/K-Means%20and%20NearMiss%20based%20Prototype%20Selection%20for%20Nearest%20Neighbor%20Classifier.pdf).
- We research on **Coordinate Descent for Logistic Regression: Integrating A\* Search and Weighted Selection**, refer to 
[Project report](./Coordinate%20Descent/Coordinate%20Descent%20for%20Logistic%20Regression%20Integrating%20AStar%20Search%20and%20Weighted%20Selection.pdf).
- The code is here [Prototype Selection](./Prototype%20Selection%20for%201-NN%20Classifier/main.py) and 
[Coordinate Descent](./Coordinate%20Descent/main.py)

## Dependencies
- See requirements [Prototype Selection](./Prototype%20Selection%20for%201-NN%20Classifier/requirements.txt) and 
[Coordinate Descent](./Coordinate%20Descent/requirements.txt)
